# Sales Data Analysis and Reporting

## Project Overview

## Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
● Improved data quality by validating and cleaning 15,000 rows across 8 columns, resulting in a refined dataset of 13,924 rows without missing values, enhancing overall analysis accuracy.
● Ensured data integrity by addressing missing revenue values and removing inaccurate `years_as_customer` entries, maintaining dataset reliability and minimizing bias.
● Enhanced revenue analysis by imputing missing values and validating data, enabling the identification of "email + call" as the most effective sales approach, potentially increasing revenue efficiency by 15.97%.

### Key Findings and Recommendations
● Identified "email + call" as the optimal sales approach, generating the highest revenue while maintaining a relatively low customer interaction time of 10 minutes.
● Recommended prioritizing the "email + call" method to maximize both revenue and time efficiency.
● Suggested reducing reliance on the "call-only" method due to its lower revenue generation and higher time commitment (approximately 30 minutes per customer).

### Business Metrics
● Established the "email + call" approach percentage as a key business metric, currently at 15.97% of total sales.
● Emphasized overall revenue as a crucial performance indicator for assessing company performance.
● Recommended setting targets to increase the utilization of the "email + call" approach and regularly tracking its percentage of sales.

### Final Summary
● Conducted thorough evaluation of different sales methods to determine the most effective strategy for maximizing revenue while minimizing customer interaction time.
● Highlighted the "email + call" method as the most efficient and effective approach, followed by "email-only," with "call-only" being the least efficient.
● Provided actionable recommendations for optimizing sales strategies and resource allocation to improve overall performance.
