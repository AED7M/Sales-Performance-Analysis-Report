# Sales Data Analysis and Reporting

## Project Overview

This project is part of my DataCamp Data Analyst certification and involves a comprehensive analysis of a sales dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and reporting. The goal is to derive meaningful insights that can aid in optimizing sales strategies and performance.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Improved data quality:** Validated and cleaned 15,000 rows across 8 columns, resulting in a refined dataset of 13,924 rows without missing values, enhancing overall analysis accuracy.
- **Ensured data integrity:** Addressed missing revenue values and removed inaccurate `years_as_customer` entries, maintaining dataset reliability and minimizing bias.
- **Enhanced revenue analysis:** Imputed missing values and validated data, enabling the identification of "email + call" as the most effective sales approach, potentially increasing revenue efficiency by 15.97%.

### Key Findings and Recommendations
- **Optimal sales approach:** Identified "email + call" as the optimal sales approach, generating the highest revenue while maintaining a relatively low customer interaction time of 10 minutes.
- **Strategy recommendation:** Prioritize the "email + call" method to maximize both revenue and time efficiency.
- **Reduce reliance on "call-only":** Suggested reducing reliance on the "call-only" method due to its lower revenue generation and higher time commitment (approximately 30 minutes per customer).

### Business Metrics
- **Key business metric:** Established the "email + call" approach percentage as a key business metric, currently at 15.97% of total sales.
- **Performance indicator:** Emphasized overall revenue as a crucial performance indicator for assessing company performance.
- **Target setting:** Recommended setting targets to increase the utilization of the "email + call" approach and regularly tracking its percentage of sales.

### Final Summary
- **Evaluation of sales methods:** Conducted a thorough evaluation of different sales methods to determine the most effective strategy for maximizing revenue while minimizing customer interaction time.
- **Efficiency highlight:** Highlighted the "email + call" method as the most efficient and effective approach, followed by "email-only," with "call-only" being the least efficient.
- **Actionable recommendations:** Provided actionable recommendations for optimizing sales strategies and resource allocation to improve overall performance.
- **Presentation creation:** Created and presented a comprehensive presentation to showcase the findings and recommendations.
